## Additional software to verify that the "# contig" given by the quast report matches the the number of contigs in the fasta files and to discover the contig length of "# unaligned contig".

Doing these using E.coli bacteria and k = 31.


### Calculating the number of contigs with length greater than x and trying to match that number to the number of # contigs.

Values of #contigs:
`
    - unitigs: 2,168 Å†
    - trivial omitigs: 1,235 
    - multi safe: 1,240 
    - flowtigs: 1,461 
    - omnitigs: 1,219
`

For each algorithm, the program gets the value 30. So, quast reports the number of contigs with lenght greater than 30, which matches with k = 31.


### Calculating the number of contigs with length greater than x and trying to match that number to the number of # unaligned contigs.

Values of #unaligned contigs:
`
    - unitigs: 1,314 
    - trivial omitigs: 135
    - multi safe: 137
    - flowtigs: 241 
    - omnitigs: 133
`

#### Results:
    - Unitigs, unaligned contigs: 1314
        > 44 : 1324
        > 45 : 1311
